      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Paul, originally from the Boston area. Moved to Utah 8 years ago. My interest in coding has been around for a while, I looked into it more once I got laid off from my previous job, I was a sales leader and many good and talented and uber qualified people were let go with me, and I thought how do I set myself apart if that ever happens again.</p>
      <p>Once completed with the program I will probably look into a salesforce certification, take that and my sales and business background and help boost any organization.</p>
